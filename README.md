# Basic Counter App with .NET Core MVC

This is build as a way for me to get myself familiar with .NET Core.

# Requirements

- The counter should not increment on every page/view - the counter increment must be session unique

- The counter should display "@counterValue Total Visitors" or similar, with the @counterValue being replaced with the current value.

- The counter should be centered at the bottom with appropriate spacing between last piece content on the page, in a bold 18 px font.

- The counter should be created and stored using Entity Framework code first database implementation using LocalDB instance of SQL Server.
